### **ECE4078 Practicals 2022: My Robotics & Intelligent Systems Journey! ü§ñ**

Welcome to my **ECE4078 Practicals 2022** repository! This is where I documented my hands-on learning experience in Intelligent Robotics. This unit provided practical insights into various aspects of robotics, from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations.

#### **What You'll Find Here üöÄ**

This repository is organized by week, reflecting the progression of the practicals:

*   **`Week01/`:** Introduction to robotics concepts and basic programming exercises.
*   **`Week02/`:** Building upon the fundamentals, likely involving sensor integration or basic robot control.
*   **`Week03/`:** More advanced topics, possibly including localization, mapping, or navigation.
*   **`Week04/`:** Further exploration into intelligent systems, perhaps involving AI or more complex robotic tasks.
*   **`dependencies.txt`:** Lists all the necessary Python libraries and other dependencies for the practicals.

#### **My Learning Journey ‚ú®**

These practicals allowed me to:

*   **Gain Hands-on Experience:** Directly apply theoretical knowledge to practical robotics problems.
*   **Develop Programming Skills:** Enhance my Python programming skills in a robotics context.
*   **Understand Robotics Concepts:** Deepen my understanding of robot kinematics, control, perception, and autonomy.
*   **Troubleshoot & Debug:** Learn to identify and resolve issues in complex robotic systems.

#### **Tech I'm Using üõ†Ô∏è**

*   Python
*   Robotics libraries (e.g., ROS, PyBullet, or custom libraries)
*   (Potentially) OpenCV for computer vision tasks
*   (Potentially) specific hardware/simulators used in the practicals
